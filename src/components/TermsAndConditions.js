            Property in the Goods will remain with Optom Shop Ltd until payment
            in full has been received by Optom Shop Ltd of all sums due,
            including interest where payable, in accordance with the Condition 4
            above. The Purchaser shall, while property in the Goods remains with
            Optom Shop Ltd pursuant to this Condition, hold the Goods on a
            fiduciary basis only and as a bailer only for the Company, keep the
            Goods separate from those of Optom Shop Ltd and third parties and
            property stores, protected and identified as Optom Shop Ltdâ€™s
            property. The Purchaser may use or re-sell the Goods in the normal
            course of its business but until Optom Shop Ltd is paid in full the
            proceeds of any sale or insurance proceeds shall be held by the
            Purchaser in trust for Optom Shop Ltd and Optom Shop Ltd shall be
            entitled to trace all proceeds of sale in accordance with equitable

            any Goods not paid for in full at any time. Risk in the Goods shall
            pass to the Purchaser on delivery. Until Optom Shop Ltd has been
            paid in full for such Goods the Purchaser shall insure the goods to
            their full value against all risks and to the reasonable
            satisfaction of Optom Shop Ltd and shall immediately pay all
            proceeds received under such insurances to Optom Shop Ltd. All
            insurance claims will be pursued by the Purchaser as swiftly and

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            The Purchaser shall inspect all Goods on delivery and shall notify
            Optom Shop Ltd of any alleged defect in materials or workmanship,
            damage or failure to comply with description or sample or shortage
            in quantity in writing within three days of physical receipt and the
            Purchaser shall notify the Carrier within seven days of physical
            receipt. It is agreed that the Purchaser waives any claims he may
            otherwise have had where claims have not been made in writing within
            the aforesaid period. The packaging and contents must be retained
            and the Purchaser shall give Optom Shop Ltd an opportunity to
            inspect the Goods within a reasonable time following delivery before
            any use is made of them. Without prejudice to the foregoing the
            Purchaser must advise Optom Shop Ltd in writing, within seven days
            of the date of receipt of an invoice, of any non-delivery of entire
            batches of Goods. Notwithstanding the receipt by Optom Shop Ltd of
            any such notice a clear signature on a Carrier's delivery advice
            sheet shall be deemed to signify receipt of the quantity of cartons
            indicated thereon. If the Purchaser shall fail to comply with the
            foregoing the Goods shall be conclusively presumed to be in
            accordance with the Contract and free from any defect in materials
            or workmanship or damage which would be apparent on a reasonable
            examination of the Goods and the Purchaser shall be deemed to have
            accepted the Goods. If the Purchaser establishes to Optom Shop Ltdâ€™s
            reasonable satisfaction that the Goods are not in accordance with
            the Contract or there is any defect in materials or workmanship, the
            Purchaser's sole remedy in respect thereof shall be limited as Optom
            Shop Ltd may elect, to making good any shortage, to replacing such
            Goods or refunding all, or part of, the Contract price against
            return of the Goods.

            to the generality of the foregoing, industrial action, war,

            non-availability of stocks or materials and any delays by third
            party manufacturers in supplying any parts or materials. Any such
